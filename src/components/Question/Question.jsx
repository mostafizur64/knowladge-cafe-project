                        <p className='mt-2'><strong>State</strong>  is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component. It's equivalent to local variables in a function.</p>
                        <p className='mt-2'><strong>Props</strong> on the other hand, make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props. They are equivalent to function parameters.</p>

                        <p className='mt-2'>It can be used like this: const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue); Here, the initialValue is the value you want to start with, and state is the current state value that can be used in your component. The setState function can be used to update the state , triggering a re-render of your component.</p>

                        <p className='mt-2'>React JS is a JavaScript-based UI development library run by Facebook and an open-source developer community. React classifies the user interface into two separate, reusable components which can be independently managed. Functional components: Also known as stateless components as they do not have a state of their own. As props, they may extract data from other components (properties). </p>
